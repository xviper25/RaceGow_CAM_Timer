# FPV Race Lap Timer for Your Phone

**Early alpha version of a web-based lap timer built for RaceGow.**

This website allows you to time FPV drone laps using just your phone’s camera—no extra hardware required.

**Live site:** [https://xviper25.github.io/RaceGow_CAM_Timer/](https://xviper25.github.io/RaceGow_CAM_Timer/)

## Getting Started

1. **Create a New Track**  
   Tracks are used to organize and store lap times.

2. **Place Your Phone**  
   Set your phone on the side of the start gate, so that the camera views the gate from the side—not straight on. This allows the timer to detect when the drone passes through.

3. **Adjust the Activation Zone**  
   Use the sliders to define the detection area. Make sure it covers slightly in front of and behind the gate.

4. **Fine-Tune Settings**  
   - **Sensitivity:** Raise the value if the drone is not triggering the lap timer.  
   - **Minimum Trigger Delay:** Increase if you experience issues with multiple triggers per pass.
